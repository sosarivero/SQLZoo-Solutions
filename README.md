# SQL Zoo Solutions
SQL Zoo is a comprehensive SQL tutorial covering fundamental concepts and advanced queries, offering interactive exercises and examples to reinforce learning. It provides a structured approach to mastering SQL commands, enabling users to develop proficiency in database querying and manipulation.

Here are the solution queries I wrote for every section of the tutorial.

## SELECT basics
1.  ```sql
    SELECT population FROM world

    ```
3. 
    ```sql
    SELECT name, area FROM world
    WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000;
