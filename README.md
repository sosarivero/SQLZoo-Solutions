SQL Zoo is a comprehensive SQL tutorial covering fundamental concepts and advanced queries, offering interactive exercises and examples to reinforce learning. It provides a structured approach to mastering SQL commands, enabling users to develop proficiency in database querying and manipulation.

Here are the solution queries I wrote for every section of the tutorial.
